### Allocation

Allocation on the ```stack``` typically happens for local variables

Allocation on the ```heap``` happens when the compiler determines 
the variable escapes the local scope (e.g., returned from a function, stored in a heap-allocated object).

```
func createInt() *int {
  x := 42
  return &x // x escapes to the heap
}
```

### Allocating Structs with ```new```:

Using the ```new``` allocates memory on the heap.

```
  type MyStruct struct{ A int }
  p := new(MyStruct) // Heap allocation
```

Notes:
  - Avoid unnecessary pointers which may lead to heap allocations.
   ```
    func processInt(x int) {
      // x passed by value, no heap allocation
    }
  ``` 

  - Slicing a large array can keep the entire array in memory. Create a smaller copy if needed.
    ```
      largeArray := [1000]int{}
      smallSlice := make([]int, 10)
      copy(smallSlice, largeArray[:10]) // Avoid holding onto largeArray
    ```

  - Use ```sync.Pool``` for Reusable Objects(avoid frequent allocations and garbage collection)
    ```
    var bufferPool = sync.Pool{
      New: func() interface{} {
          return make([]byte, 1024)
      },
    }
    func process() {
      buf := bufferPool.Get().([]byte)
      // Use buf
      bufferPool.Put(buf) // Reuse buffer
    }

  - Use Goâ€™s profiling tools ```pprof``` ```trace```

    ```


If the function can be inlined, the ownership of the construction moves up to the calling function

```
func fn() {
  // Before inlining
  input := bytes.NewReader(data) // <- Original Call
   
  // After inlining
  input := &bytes.Reader{ buf: data } // <- After Inlining Optimization
}
```



### GC mark assist

GC activates the GC ```mark assist``` to speed up the marking process.

GC ```mark assist``` in Go helps dynamically adjusting the resources allocated to the garbage collector, during the mark phase to keep up with the pace of object allocation

Could be the situation when all the Goroutines in ```mark assist``` to help slowdown allocations and get the initial GC finished.

### Performance notes

- If you notice a lot of time spent in the ```runtime.mallocgc``` function, it suggests that the program may be making too many small memory allocations

- If you're spending a significant amount of time managing channel operations, ```sync.Mutex``` code, or other synchronization elements in your program, it's likely facing contention issues. 

To improve performance, think about restructuring the program to reduce the frequent access of shared resources. 

Common techniques for this include techniques:
- ```sharding/partitioning``` 
- ```buffering/batching``` 
- ```copy-on-write``` 

- If your program spends a significant amount of time in ```syscall.Read/Write```, it might be doing too many small reads and writes. 
  Using ```bufio``` wrappers around ```os.File``` or ```net.Conn``` can be helpful in this situation

- If your program is spending a lot of time in the ```GC (Garbage Collection)``` component, it could be because it's either creating too many temporary objects or because the heap size is too small, leading to frequent garbage collections:
  
    - Large objects impact memory usage and GC pacing, whereas numerous small allocations affect marking speed

    - Combine values into larger ones to reduce memory allocations and alleviate pressure on the garbage collector, resulting in faster garbage collections

    - Values without pointers aren't scanned by the garbage collector. Eliminating pointers from actively used values can enhance garbage collection efficiency

### Run Bench

```
// generate pprof and binary
# go test -bench . -benchmem -memprofile p.out -gcflags -m=2
# go test -bench . -benchtime 3s -benchmem -memprofile p.out
# go test -bench . -benchtime 3s -benchmem -cpuprofile p.out -gcflags -m=2

// run tools
# go tool pprof -noinlines p.out
# go tool pprof --noinlines  memcpu.test p.out

// Profiling commands
# go tool pprof -http :8080 stream.test p.out
# press ```o```
# list <func_name>
# weblist <func_name>
```

### Inlining optimization

Inlining is an optimization technique used by compilers, including the Go compiler, to improve the performance of a program.

Basic idea behind inlining is to replace a function call with the actual body of the function

This can eliminate the overhead associated with the function call, such as stack manipulation and jump instructions, thereby making the program faster.


Cons:
  - Increased Binary Size
  - Larger binaries can negatively impact CPU cache performance

Viewing Inlining Decisions
  - use the ```-gcflags``` compiler flag with ```go build``` or ```go test```
